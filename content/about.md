title: Who?
---

My name is Miguel Cardoso, also known around the web as **plzp4n1c**.

I'm currently focused on Cloud Security @CriticalTechworks. I also have experience in SOC/NOC (graveyard shifts, know them well). On my free time I like to try and break stupid things and waste time learning.

I'm addicted to grabbing those flags.
